  <h2>Whatever you answered to that, here all I want is to put before you information that you wouldn't normally get, I won't try to force you to believe something, or tell you what to think, but simply increase the information you have access to. What you make of what I say is your choice. By the day it becomes more and more clear to everyone that a big change is coming, one way or another, so I want you to whatever conclusion you come to, remember at least this: the smallest minority is that of 1 person with their own opinions, so I tell you to read this for yourself first, not worrying about what someone else will say or think, and that includes me, if you feel offended or like you disagree with anything I say, feel free to discard that.</h2>
